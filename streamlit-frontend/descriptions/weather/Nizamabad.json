    "evalutation_description": "The RMSE scores for the Prophet model on the test dataset was very low (5.13 approx) and we were also able to get a good accuracy score of 87.74% for the test data",
    "model_usage_reasoning": "Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. From the historical data of Adilabad we could infer a lot of seasonality trends in the data, and hence the model was found to be working perfectly."
