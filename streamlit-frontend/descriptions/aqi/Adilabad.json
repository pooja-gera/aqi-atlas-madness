    "evalutation_description": "The RMSE scores for the Prophet model on the test dataset was very low (4.9 approx) and we were also able to get a good accuracy score of 92.75% for the test data",
    "model_usage_reasoning": " Holtâ€™s smoothing technique, also known as linear exponential smoothing, is a widely known smoothing model for forecasting data that has a trend. We implemented most of the time series models and LSTM RNN models and compared their RMSE scores on the test set for AQI prediction for Adilabad and found that Holtz models gave the best results. Also this model was able to capture the trends of the AQI data properly and generalize as well."
